Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering can be defined as the systematic process of designing,developing,deploying and maintenaning software products.
It is essential as it enables creation of software applications and systems that run various aspects of modern life.eg E-Commerce

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages eg C language
2.Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in the 1960s.
3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements - Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2.Design -involves creating a high level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation -this basically invoves writing the code and building the software according to design specifications
4.Testing -Conducting a several tests to ensure the software product meets quality standards and serves the intended function.
5.Deployment - releasing the software to users
6.Maintenance -updating and enhancing the softare features after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development which involves clearly defined stages whereas
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
The Waterfall methodology would be appropriate for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal expected changes.
Agile would be appropriate for projects where requirements are expected to evolve, such as developing a mobile app or creating a web-based startup platform,
where customer needs and market conditions can change rapidly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer -writes codes and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures that software quality is not compromised.QA achieves this by designing and executing tests plans
Project Manager - Oversees the planning,execution and software delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS are examples of the tools used in software development.This tools are important as they enhance productivity,collaboration and code quality.
IDEs Example - Visual studio
VCS Example - Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges
1.Changing requirements
2.Technical debt
3.Tight project deadlines
Solutions
1.Utilizing agile methodologies
2.Prioritization of tasks for time management
3.Effective communication

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - entails testing individual components of software
Intergration testing - invoves testing interations between different components.
System testing - testing the whole software
Acceptance testing -involves testing the  software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promt engineering entails crafting of right questions/instructions/statements in order to get the very best response from an AI model.
Importance
Helps get clear ,high quality and specific responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - write a code that adds two numbers.
Improved version - Write a code that adds two numbers and prompts the user to input the numbers.Write your code using python language.

The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear,concise,complete and correct.
